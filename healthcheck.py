"""healthcheck.py - check the health of a fleet of servers, and say so with an exit code.

YOUR TEAM WRITES THIS TOOL. This file is the entry point, and some of it is done
for you: the command-line arguments, the logging setup and the overall shape of
a run. The checks themselves live in the checks/ package, one module per check,
so that several of you can work at once on separate branches.

Run it, with the fake fleet running in another terminal:

    python healthcheck.py
    python healthcheck.py --config other.yaml
    python healthcheck.py --json-report reports/report.json
    python healthcheck.py --help

The exit code is a contract. Do not invent new codes:

    0  every target healthy
    1  something degraded (reachable, but failing a check), or the config is bad
    2  something down (unreachable, refused, timed out, or does not resolve)

Your closing demo is one line:

    python healthcheck.py && echo "DEPLOY"

The second command runs only if the first exits 0. That is a pipeline gate,
four weeks before you meet Jenkins.
