"""report.py - turn a list of CheckResults into something people and programs can read.

Two audiences, two formats. The console table is for the person running the
tool right now. The JSON report is for whatever reads it next: another script,
a ticket, or the same tool tomorrow comparing today against yesterday.

Neither replaces the log file. The log says what happened and when. The report
says what was true at the end.

YOU WRITE THIS. The signatures are fixed, because healthcheck.py and alerts.py
already call them.
